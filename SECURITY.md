# Security Policy

We take security seriously.

- **Supported versions**: the latest `main` branch and the most recent tagged release.
- **Reporting a vulnerability**: please email the maintainers with a minimal repro if possible.
- **Disclosure**: we will acknowledge receipt within 72 hours and work on a fix before public disclosure.

When in doubt, err on the side of contacting us privately first.
